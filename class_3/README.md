Perform the following imputation tasks on the provided csv file.


1) Create the data frame, say DF, by reading the CSV file provided in the attachment.

2)  Check whether it contains missing values or not. The value 9999 in any row must be considered as a missing value. 

3) Create a copy of the data frame, CDF, by replacing the missing values with a NaN value.

4) Create a copy of CDF, CDF1, and apply the basic imputation technique on CDF1 that replaces NaN values with zeros

5)  Create a copy of CDF, CDF2,  and apply the mean imputation technique.

6) Create a copy of DF, CDF3,  and apply the most frequent imputation technique.

7)  Create a copy of DF,  say CDF4,  and apply the linear regression technique.
